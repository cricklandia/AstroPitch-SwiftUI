# AstroPitch-SwiftUI
This is an attempt by RamRam Studios at the AstroPitch concept using SwiftUI and AVFoundation. We've already tried UIKit (storyboards) to implement the idea but found SwiftUI to be a more consistent, less cumbersome way to develop.

Astropitch has developed a way to translate astrology into music using the position of your planets at your exact time of birth. All you need is your exact time of birth to reveal your astrological frequencies. Discover your unique resonance and compare with friends!


Main Project Concept

Combine the elements of Astrology with Music Harmonic Principles to add dimension to the Astrological categorizations that help individuals understand their inherent personality traits in order to better perceive their tendencies and manners of navigating the world and personal relationships.
The Music Harmonic Principles would help define a personâ€™s resonance and give them insight into how they resonate with others.

The project will use a mathematical approach to determining the frequencies which correspond to a person based on when they were born. That approach has yet to be developed.
